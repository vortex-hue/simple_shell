##Simple Shell - simple UNIX command interpreter

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone using feynmann learning technique:

## Output
<p>Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as w\
ell as the exact same error output.
<p>The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to\
 your argv[0] (See below)
<p> Example of error with sh:

### $ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
### /bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
### $ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
### /bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
